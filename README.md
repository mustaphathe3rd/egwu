## Inspiration

Music has always been a central part of my life, so the idea of a music-based game was a recurring thought. In November 2024, I serendipitously discovered Spotify’s API. After experimenting with it for a few days, I decided to build the project I’d always craved. Research showed that Gen Z spends about 15.5% of a 24-hour day either gaming or listening to music (roughly 29.27% of their waking hours), which reinforced the idea of creating an application that blends immersive music listening with interactive gaming.

I envisioned future integrations with platforms like Apple’s iMessage, allowing friends and strangers to connect over music-related games, and saw potential applications in karaoke settings and other events. A big shout-out goes to my peers whose creative energy and collaborative spirit were instrumental during the incubation of this idea.

## What It Does

**ègwu** transforms your Spotify data into a series of engaging games:

- **Complete the Lyrics (Voice and Text):**  
  Fill in the missing lyrics generated by an AI challenge. Users can either type or speak their answers.
  
- **Artist Guess:**  
  Guess an artist from your most-listened list based on progressive clues—genre, origin, and hints that indicate closeness of your guess to the actual artist.
  
- **Crossword:**  
  Solve crosswords generated from your favorite song lyrics, with AI-assisted clue generation and puzzle mapping.
  
- **Trivia:**  
  Answer multiple-choice questions derived from the biographies of your most-listened artists, complete with explanations for the correct answers.

Each game mode is supported by robust data fetching, caching, and real-time analytics for a smooth user experience.

## How We Built It

### Backend

- **Project Structure:**  
  The repository contains two separate folders:  
  - **Backend:** Handles game logic, database operations, data fetching, and caching.
  - **Frontend:** Manages client rendering and parts of the game logic.

- **Django Apps:**  
  - **Spotify App:**  
    - Manages user login using Spotify’s OAuth.
    - Asynchronously fetches user data (username, image URL, listening habits) and enriches it using APIs such as Genius (with web scraping), Wikipedia, Discogs, and Last.fm.
    - Handles JWT authentication across the project.
    - Provides a `processing_status` endpoint to signal the frontend when user data fetching is complete.
  
  - **Spotify_games App:**  
    - Imports the user model from the Spotify app and uses JWT for seamless authorization.
    - Implements game logic for various modes:
      - **Complete the Lyrics (Voice/Text):**  
        Uses Google PaLM AI to generate challenges from random song lyrics. Validates user responses via audio transcription (using the AudioSegment library) or text comparison.
      - **Artist Guess:**  
        Randomly selects an artist from the user’s most-listened list and provides progressive clues using a color-coded hint system.
      - **Crossword:**  
        Generates crossword puzzles from song lyrics, with AI-assisted generation of words and clues.
      - **Trivia:**  
        Crafts multiple-choice questions from artist biographies, complete with correct answers and detailed explanations.
    - Incorporates robust caching and analytics to improve performance.

### Frontend

- Initialized using React with Vite.
- Developed a user-friendly interface for interacting with various game modes, despite limited proficiency in React.

## Challenges We Ran Into

- **Asynchronous Data Fetching:**  
  Managing threading issues during asynchronous data operations required careful handling of concurrent tasks.

- **Operational Costs and API Limitations:**  
  Integrating AI APIs was challenging due to high operational costs and limited responses from free-tier services.

- **Solo Development:**  
  Building the project single-handedly meant overcoming both technical and creative challenges on my own.

- **The Challenge of Titulation:**  
  After the stress of application development, I was bemused by how difficult it was to conjure a project name. Ultimately, I settled on **ègwu**, which roughly translates to both "music" and "game" in my native language, Igbo.

## Accomplishments

- **Integrated Multi-API Architecture:**  
  Successfully combined data from Spotify, Genius, Wikipedia, Discogs, and Last.fm to enrich the gaming experience.

- **Robust Game Logic Across Multiple Modes:**  
  Implemented diverse game modes with unique challenges and validations using AI services and real-time processing.

- **Efficient Authentication and Data Handling:**  
  Developed a seamless authentication system with JWT and optimized data fetching and caching mechanisms.

- **Rapid Prototyping:**  
  Delivered a fully functional prototype that unites music streaming with interactive gaming, all within a tight development schedule.

## What We Learned

This project was an incredible learning journey. I expanded my knowledge in:

- **Backend Development:**  
  Deepened my expertise in Django, Python, and Django REST Framework.
  
- **Frontend Technologies:**  
  Gained hands-on experience with React and Vite.
  
- **Authentication and Data Management:**  
  Implemented secure JWT authentication, caching, and API integration.
  
- **Advanced Programming Techniques:**  
  Applied concepts like asynchronous programming, object-oriented design, and decorator patterns.
  
- **Problem-Solving and Patience:**  
  Learned to overcome threading issues, manage API constraints, and tackle challenges independently.

## What's Next

Future plans for **ègwu** include:

- **Expanding Game Modes:**  
  Introduce additional challenges and refine existing ones based on user feedback.
  
- **Enhancing Social Integration:**  
  Integrate with platforms like Apple’s iMessage for real-time, social gaming experiences.
  
- **Performance Optimization:**  
  Further improve caching, analytics, and overall responsiveness.
  
- **Broadening Music Data Sources:**  
  Integrate additional music APIs to expand the range of metadata available for personalized gameplay.
  
- **Scaling the Platform:**  
  Prepare for broader adoption by optimizing the application for increased traffic and a larger user base.
