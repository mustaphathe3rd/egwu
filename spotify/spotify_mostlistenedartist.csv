Early life
==========
Kendrick Lamar Duckworth was born on June 17, 1987, in Compton, California. He is the first child of former gang hustler Kenneth ""Kenny"" Duckworth and hairdresser Paula Oliver. Both of his parents are African Americans from the South Side of Chicago. When they were teenagers, they relocated to Compton in 1984, due to his father's affiliation with the Gangster Disciples. Lamar was named after singer-songwriter Eddie Kendricks of the Temptations. He was an only child until the age of seven and was described as a loner by his mother. Eventually, his parents had his two younger brothers and younger sister, businesswoman Kayla Sawyer (née Duckworth). His cousins include basketball player Nick Young and rapper Baby Keem.
Lamar and his family lived in Section 8 housing, were reliant on welfare and food stamps, and experienced homelessness. Although he is not a member of a particular gang, he grew up with close affiliates of the Westside Pirus. Despite suffering hardships, Lamar remembered having ""good memories"" of his childhood that sparked his interest in hip hop music, such as sneaking into his parents' house parties. He was raised secular, although he occasionally attended church services and was taught the Bible by his grandmother. He felt ""spiritually unsatisfied"" as a child due to the ""empty"" and ""one-sided"" nature of the sermons.
After hearing a recording of his voice for the first time, Lamar became interested in rapping. He was introduced to police brutality after experiencing the first day of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. When he was five years old, he witnessed a murder for the first time while sitting outside of his apartment unit, as a teenage drug dealer was killed in a drive-by shooting. ""It done something to me right then and there,"" Lamar later admitted to NPR Music. ""It let me know that this is not only something that I'm looking at, but it's something that maybe I have to get used to."" His parents nicknamed him ""Man-Man"" due to his precocious behavior, although he confessed it ""put a stigma on the idea of me reacting as a kid sometimes—I would hurt myself and they would expect me not to cry.""
In school, Lamar was a quiet and observant student who excelled academically and had a noticeable stutter. His first grade teacher at Robert E. McNair Elementary School encouraged him to become a writer after she heard him correctly use the word ""audacity"". As a seventh grade student at Vanguard Learning Center, Lamar was introduced to poetry by his English teacher, Regis Inge. Inge integrated the literary form into his curriculum as a response to the growing racial tensions amongst his students. Through its connection to hip hop, Lamar studied rhymes, metaphors and double entendres, which made him fall in love with songwriting: ""You can put all your feelings down on a sheet of paper, and they'd make sense to you. I liked that."" Instead of completing assignments for other classes, Lamar would scribe lyrics in his notebooks. His initial writing was entirely profane, but it helped him manage his psychological trauma and depression, which he struggled with during his adolescence. Inge played a vital role in his intellectual growth, often criticizing his lexicon and suggesting prompts to strengthen his prose.
Lamar later attended Centennial High School. He was enrolled in summer school during the tenth grade, which he dreaded because it forced him to be embroiled in a gang war. Despite his efforts to avoid them, Lamar soon became heavily involved with Compton's hedonistic gang culture, which led to numerous health scares and encounters with the police. He distanced himself from the lifestyle following an intervention staged by his father. When he was 16, Lamar was baptized and converted to Christianity following the death of a friend. He graduated from high school in 2005 as a straight-A student. He considered studying psychology and astronomy in college, but suspended his academic pursuits to focus on his music career.


Personal life
=============
Lamar began dating his fiancée Whitney Alford when they were in high school. Lamar announced his engagement to Alford in April 2015. They welcomed their first child, Uzi, on July 26, 2019. The couple used the cover art for Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers to announce the birth of their second son, Enoch, in 2022.
Lamar is a teetotaler and lives a drug-free lifestyle. In an October 2012 interview, he stated that he once tried marijuana, but the blunt had been laced with PCP, and he has not used any drugs since. In an interview with Starz, Lamar stated he asked to play a drug abuser on the TV series Power, saying: ""[Laces] is just a character that I know. I know so well, just growing up in Compton. You grow this type of love for them, you know, in this weird kind of way. You know, you don't want to see nothing happen to them, but you know he's dangerous.""

Influences
alt=Headshot of Tupac Shakur on a white background|left|thumb|Lamar considers Tupac Shakur to be his biggest influence.
Tupac Shakur is Lamar's biggest influence, having impacted both his professional and personal lives. One of his earliest childhood memories is watching him and Dr. Dre film the second music video for their single ""California Love"" with his father at the Compton Swap Meet. Lamar has described himself as an ""offspring"" of Shakur's artistry and sociopolitical views. Although some publications have regarded him as the Shakur of his generation, he has strived to maintain his individuality.
Shakur's The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory (1996), The Notorious B.I.G.'s Life After Death (1997), and DMX's It's Dark and Hell is Hot (1998) influenced Lamar's artistic direction: ""I don't look at these albums like just music; it sounds like an actual film."" He also listened and took influence from Mos Def and Snoop Dogg during his childhood, and said, ""I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for Eazy-E."" 50 Cent's mixtape success inspired Lamar to become an independent artist, while his view on being categorized as a conscious rapper, ""Yeah, I'm a conscious artist because I have a conscience"", gave him a sense of perspective.
Prodigy of Mobb Deep was a key influence on Lamar's earlier mixtapes, while his rapping technique was stemmed from Lil Wayne and his longevity. Eminem and his album The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) introduced him to songwriting elements, such as ad-libs, and impacted his aggressive approach to records such as ""Backseat Freestyle"". He took inspiration from N.W.A's tenacity of representing his hometown with ""courage, honesty and artistic brilliance"". Various R&B and soul artists, including Marvin Gaye, the Isley Brothers, Michael Jackson, Teddy Pendergrass, Sade, and Anita Baker, have influenced Lamar. He performed with Prince, who impacted his vocal register, at Paisley Park to celebrate the release of the latter's 2014 albums Plectrumelectrum and Art Official Age, which GQ described as ""five minutes of brilliant insanity"". To Pimp a Butterfly was influenced by the works of jazz trumpeter Miles Davis and funk collective Parliament-Funkadelic.
Musical style
The nature of Lamar's musical style has been described as ""anti-flamboyant, interior and complex."" He is rooted in West Coast hip hop, and has continually reinvented his sound by branching out into other genres. Due to his contributions to its audience growth, through his appeal to mainstream listeners, music critics generally categorize Lamar as a progressive rap artist. He suggests that his music is genreless, explaining in a 2012 interview, ""You really can't categorize my music, it's human music."" PopDust opined that during the 2010s, a decade that was arguably defined by hip hop, Lamar constantly pushed the boundaries of what the genre could be.
Lamar did not care for music production during the beginning of his career. However, as he placed an emphasis on songwriting and ""making material that's universal"", he grew more exacting and adventurous with his compositions. He is heavily involved with every aspect of his production process, including the mixing and mastering stages, and is known for working long hours in the recording studio. ""You gotta be hands on and know the different sounds and frequencies,"" Lamar explained to Variety. ""What makes people move, what melodies stick with you, taking the higher octaves and the lower octaves and learning how to intertwine that in a certain frequency, how to manipulate sound to your advantage."" Lamar chooses to work with a close-knit team of musicians, rather than constantly seek high-profile talent. He has been working with his longtime producer, Sounwave, since his 2009 self-titled EP.
Kendrick Lamar marked a pivotal change in Lamar's artistry. Unlike his earlier mixtapes, which consisted of freestyles over CHR and urban radio singles, the EP incorporated melancholic and ""doleful"" original production that emphasized his lyrics. Austere jazz production was blended with alternative rap styles on Section.80, with instrumentals drawing from R&B, boom bap, psychedelia, and downtempo. Good Kid, M.A.A.D City abandoned the tastes of contemporary hip hop by exploring a subtle, atmospheric side of West Coast hip hop and gangsta rap. To Pimp a Butterfly is an amalgamation of genres synonymous with African-American music, most prominently jazz, funk, and soul. It redefined jazz rap by highlighting improvisation and soloing rather than primarily using sampling. Minimalist arrangements are incorporated in Damn and Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers. Damn appealed to mainstream listeners through its pop and R&B-influenced production, while the scattered and distorted instrumentals of Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers was designed to make listeners feel anxious and uncomfortable. GNX was an homage to the West Coast, with g-funk synths, West Coast-inspired beats and flows, and features from various underground Los Angeles rappers such as Hitta J3, YoungThreat, Peysoh, Lefty Gunplay, Wallie the Sensei, and Siete7x.
Voice
Several media outlets consider Lamar to be the greatest and most important rapper of his generation. Billboard, Forbes and Vibe named him the second-greatest rapper of all time, behind Jay-Z. Described as a ""blazing"" technical rapper and ""relentless searcher"" by The New York Times, Lamar's ""limber, dexterous"" flow switches from derivative to generative metrics, while incorporating internal and multisyllabic rhyme schemes. His rhymes are typically manipulated within common time, allowing him to subtly control his metrical phonology and suggest formal ambiguities similar to pop and rock repertoires. Some of his rhyme manipulations feature ""flexible"" new school styles evoking the 1990s, while others use ""rigid"" old school elements recalling the 1980s. Lamar frequently uses syncopation in his melodies to create contradictions between his lyrical content and rhythms. With Good Kid, M.A.A.D City, he liberally plays with pronunciation, inflections, and delivery to mirror the album's emotional range.
Lamar possesses a versatile tenor vocal range and a raspy, half-shout timbre, where ""his throat sounds dry and his mouth sounds wet."" André 3000 was the first rapper that introduced him to singing sensibilities in hip hop, and he writes melody-driven songs as practice for his albums. Lamar became comfortable with his vocals over time, to the point where he feels confident enough to create singing-based albums. Pitchfork noticed how his harmonies on To Pimp a Butterfly never made him sound alone throughout his ""desolate"" performance; comparing his vocal layering to ""standing in the middle, unnoticed, of a large quarrelsome crowd.""
Praised for his willingness to use his voice as an instrument, Lamar adopts different cadences, tones, modulations, and timbres to suggest conflicting personalities, paint distinct emotions, and communicate stories using characters and personas. His falsetto register, which he calls the ""ghetto falsetto"", has been likened to Curtis Mayfield's. MTV writes that by manipulating his voice, Lamar calls back to a lineage that runs through James Brown's foundational work in the 1960s, 1970s psychedelia, Prince's ""sweaty"" phantasmagoria in the 1980s, and 1990s gangsta rap. He was ranked the tenth-best solo singer of the 21st century by The Times in 2023.
Songwriting
Branded as a ""master of storytelling"" by The New Yorker, Lamar has been referred to as one of the greatest lyricists in modern hip hop by several publications and his peers. Pharrell Williams suggests that what makes his songwriting stand out is because he ""knows how to be very disciplined with a subject matter, he knows that stickiness is important, and he knows that it has to be great."" American Songwriter notes that for as much as Lamar is a musician, lyricist, and emcee, he is also ""a playwright, a novelist, a short story author. He's literary within the art form of music."" Lamar's reflective narrative songwriting pulls from a wide range of literary and cinematic techniques, such as hip hop skits and voice-overs, to allow his audience to follow internal and external storylines. His fusion of various film styles and his sonic influence has elevated his works to be some of the most ""consistently poignant"" in hip hop, and promoted the advancement of the narrative device.
Lamar, who self-identifies as a musician and writer, begins his songwriting process with an assortment of premeditated thoughts that he jotted down over the course of one year. His personal experiences are a common source of inspiration, but he also pulls ideas from meeting new people, traveling, and experiencing different cultures. A devout Christian, he additionally shares his spiritual triumphs and struggles on his songs. He is an avid note-taker, and has developed keywords, phrases, and sounds to help him ""trigger the exact emotions"" he felt when writing the initial demo. Considered to be a ""radio-friendly but overtly political rapper"" by Pitchfork, and a populist by The Wall Street Journal, Lamar's songwriting regularly infuses political criticism and social commentary concerning African-American culture. Common themes explored include racial inequality, institutional discrimination, and black empowerment. Lamar's critiques has been compared to the State of the Union Address by The Guardian, while Billboard described it as ""Shakespearean"". HuffPost opined that his work is a ""great"" piece of journalism because it ""speaks from the prerogative of black communities facing oppression and directly attacks the institutions responsible for their pain,"" an achievement most reporters cannot attain.
Lamar tries to carry a conceptual idea inside of his music, ""whether it's a big concept or it's so subtle you can't even tell until you get to 20 listens."" Fans and publications have theorized that his albums are related to different forms of mass media. Section.80 is regarded as a short story collection inspired and themed around events that impacted the millennial generation, such as Ronald Reagan's presidency. The nonlinear narrative structure of Good Kid, M.A.A.D City is billed as a coming-of-age short film that chronicles Lamar's harsh teenage experiences in his native Compton. Its cinematic scope has been compared to the screenplays written by filmmakers Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino. To Pimp a Butterfly unfolds as both a poem and blank letter that explores the responsibilities of being a role model and documents life as an African American during Barack Obama's presidency. Damn is labeled as an introspective satire that explores the dualities of human nature and morality. Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers takes on the form of a theatrical play, with confessional lyrics based on Lamar's experiences in therapy.

After graduating from John Ehret High School in Marrero, Louisiana in 2005, Ocean enrolled in the University of New Orleans to study English.

Tyler, the Creator and other members of OFWGKTA tweeted their support for Ocean. Russell Simmons wrote a congratulatory article in Global Grind in which he said, ""Today is a big day for hip-hop. It is a day that will define who we really are. How compassionate will we be? How loving can we be? How inclusive are we? [...] Your decision to go public about your sexual orientation gives hope and light to so many young people still living in fear."" When asked if he considers himself bisexual in a 2012 interview, Ocean stated: ""I'll respectfully say that life is dynamic and comes along with dynamic experiences, and the same sentiment that I have towards genres of music, I have towards a lot of labels and boxes and shit.""

Musical style and progression
Early in his career, Miller's music was widely regarded as ""frat rap"", with lyrics focusing on partying, smoking marijuana, and lusting after fame, money, and women. After the mixed critical response of Blue Slide Park, Miller began to employ a more expressive and experimental approach to his subsequent releases. By the release of Swimming, a review of Rolling Stone stated that Miller had shed his frat rap reputation.
Miller experimented with jazz in his career as well. In 2012, Miller released You, an EP featuring lounge-jazz tracks as Larry Lovestein and the Velvet Revival. Speaking about the Larry Lovestein persona, Miller stated ""I've kinda have always had this random fantasy of being a seventy-year-old Lounge Jazz singer.""
Toward the latter half of Miller's career, his music further implemented elements of jazz and additionally branched to funk and R&B. Faces incorporated jazz, while The Divine Feminine and Swimming have both been described by music publications as jazz rap. Rolling Stone writer Danny Schwartz also described Swimming as ""spanning rap, funk, and trip-hop.""
Influences
Miller included Big L, Lauryn Hill, Beastie Boys, Outkast, and A Tribe Called Quest among his influences. He had a close relationship with fellow Pittsburgh rapper Wiz Khalifa, saying ""Wiz has been a big brother to me with this music thing so far. Our relationship is beyond music. He really is just my homie, whether I will be making music or not."" Miller also expressed admiration for John Lennon. He had multiple tattoos of Lennon, including a tattoo of Lennon's face and a tattoo of his song ""Imagine"".


Personal life
=============
Miller spoke openly about his struggle with substance abuse and depression. To manage stress during his Macadelic Tour in 2012, Miller began taking promethazine, and later became addicted to lean. Miller told Complex in January 2013: ""I love lean; it's great. I was not happy and I was on lean very heavy. I was so fucked up all the time it was bad. My friends couldn't even look at me the same. I was lost."" He quit taking promethazine in November 2012, before shooting his reality show Mac Miller and the Most Dope Family. In 2014, Miller was taking drugs daily, and felt that the final track on Faces, ""Grand Finale"", was ""supposed to be the last song [he] made on Earth."" Recounting that period to Billboard in August 2015, Miller appraised he had become ""definitely way healthier"" since then, but ""not completely sober"". After stating he ""hated"" being sober in a February 2016 documentary, Miller had become sober for three months by October 2016, noting his better mood and maintained creativity. However, when asked about his sobriety in April 2017, Miller said he was now ""living regularly"".
Miller was in an on-again, off-again relationship with writer Nomi Leasure, whom he met in middle school, for seven years until 2016. Many of the songs on his mixtape Macadelic were about their relationship. Miller dated singer Ariana Grande from August 2016 to May 2018.
Legal issues
In February 2011, while on tour in Upstate New York, Miller and his friends were arrested for possession of marijuana for which they spent the night in jail. Miller said the case was ""settled"".
Producer Lord Finesse filed a $10 million lawsuit against Miller, Rostrum Records and DatPiff in July 2012, for the use of a sample of Finesse's song ""Hip 2 Da Game"" in Miller's 2010 mixtape song ""Kool-Aid and Frozen Pizza"". In December 2012, the lawsuit was settled out of court with its stipulations kept confidential.
In March 2015, the band Aquarian Dream filed a $150,000 lawsuit against Miller for sampling their song ""Yesterday (Was So Nice Today)"" in the song ""Therapy"" that appeared on Miller's 2014 mixtape Faces.
Miller was arrested in May 2018 on charges of driving under the influence and hit and run after crashing into a utility pole and fleeing the scene with two passengers. Police obtained his address from his license plate number, and Miller confessed when police arrived at his home. He was taken into custody and released on $15,000 bail. In August 2018, Miller was charged with two counts of driving under the influence for the incident. Miller died before his arraignment, and the charges were dropped.

================


Early life
==========
Kanye Omari West was born on June 8, 1977, in Atlanta, Georgia. After his parents divorced when he was three years old, he moved with his mother to Chicago, Illinois. His father, Ray West, is a former Black Panther and was one of the first black photojournalists at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Ray later became a Christian counselor, and in 2006, opened the Good Water Store and Café in Lexington Park, Maryland, with startup capital from his son. West's mother, Donda C. West (née Williams), was a professor of English at Clark Atlanta University and the Chair of the English Department at Chicago State University before retiring to serve as his manager.
West was raised in a middle-class environment, attending Polaris School for Individual Education in suburban Oak Lawn, Illinois, after living in Chicago. At the age of 10, West moved with his mother to Nanjing, China, where she was teaching at Nanjing University as a Fulbright Scholar. According to his mother, West was the only foreigner in his class, but he settled in well and quickly picked up the language, although he has since forgotten most of it. When asked about his grades in high school, West replied, ""I got A's and B's.""
West demonstrated an affinity for the arts at an early age; he began writing poetry when he was five years old. West started rapping in the third grade and began making musical compositions in the seventh grade, eventually selling them to other artists. West crossed paths with producer No I.D., who became West's friend and mentor. After graduating from high school, West received a scholarship to attend Chicago's American Academy of Art in 1997 and began taking painting classes. Shortly after, he transferred to Chicago State University to study English. At age 20, he dropped out to pursue his musical career.West, Donda, p. 106 This greatly displeased his mother, who was also a professor at the university, although she would later accept the decision.


Personal life
=============
West has been one of the wealthiest musical artists; his net worth was as high as $1.8 billion in 2021. In October 2022, Forbes estimated his net worth to have dropped to $400 million in large part due to Adidas's termination of their partnership following a series of public antisemitic statements.
Name change
In August 2021, West applied to court to have his legal name changed from ""Kanye Omari West"" to ""Ye"", with no middle or last name; he cited ""personal reasons"" for the change. The request was granted by Michelle Williams Court, a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge, in October 2021. West had alluded to wishing to change his name since 2018 and had used Ye as a nickname for several years prior, stating in a 2018 interview that he believed ""ye"" () was the most commonly used word in the Bible: ""In the Bible it means 'you'. So, I'm you. I'm us. It's us. It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye.""
Relationships and family
Kim Kardashian
In April 2012, West began dating reality television star Kim Kardashian, with whom he had already been long-time friends. West and Kardashian became engaged in October 2013, and married at Fort di Belvedere in Florence in May 2014. Their private ceremony was subject to widespread mainstream coverage, with which West took issue.Lee, Christina. ""Kanye West Blasts Media Coverage Of Kim Kardashian In Wedding Speech.""  Idolator. May 28, 2014. The couple's high-profile status and respective careers have resulted in their relationship becoming subject to heavy media coverage; The New York Times referred to their marriage as ""a historic blizzard of celebrity"".
West and Kardashian have four children: North West (born June 2013), Saint West (born December 2015), Chicago West (born via surrogate in January 2018), and Psalm West (born via surrogate in May 2019). In July 2020, during a presidential campaign rally of his, West revealed that he had previously considered abortion during Kardashian's first pregnancy but has since taken anti-abortion views. In April 2015, West and Kardashian traveled to Jerusalem to have North baptized in the Armenian Apostolic Church at the Cathedral of St. James.
In September 2018, West announced that he would be permanently moving back to Chicago to establish his Yeezy company headquarters there. This did not actually occur, and West instead went on to purchase two ranches near Cody, Wyoming, where he recorded his eighth solo studio album, Ye. Kardashian resides with their children in a home that the now-divorced couple owns in California, whereas West moved into a home across the street to continue to be near their children. In October 2021, West began the process of selling his Wyoming ranch.
In July 2020, West acknowledged the possibility of Kardashian ending their marriage due to his adoption of anti-abortion views. Later that month, West wrote on Twitter that he had been attempting to divorce Kardashian. He also wrote that the Kardashian family was attempting ""to lock [him] up"". In January 2021, CNN reported that the couple were discussing divorce. A month later, Kardashian filed for divorce, with the couple citing ""irreconcilable differences"", agreeing to joint custody of their children, and declining spousal support from each other. The divorce settlement was finalized in November 2022, and West was ordered to pay $200,000 in monthly child support and be responsible for half of the children's medical, educational, and security expenses.
Other relationships
West began an on-and-off relationship with the designer Alexis Phifer in 2002, and they became engaged in August 2006. They ended their 18-month engagement in 2008. Phifer stated that the pair had split amicably and remained friends. West dated model Amber Rose from 2008 until mid-2010. In an interview following their split, West stated that he had to take ""30 showers"" before committing to his next relationship with Kim Kardashian. In response, Rose stated that she had been ""bullied"" and ""slut-shamed"" by West throughout their relationship.
In January 2022, actress Julia Fox confirmed in an Interview essay that she was dating West. West continued to say that he wanted his ""family back"" and publicly lashed out at Kardashian's new boyfriend, comedian Pete Davidson. His treatment of Davidson and Kardashian has been described by commentators as harassment and abusive; the 64th Annual Grammy Awards dropped him as a performer in response to his ""concerning online behavior"". Less than two months after confirming their relationship, Fox said that she and West had split up but remained on good terms. She later said that she dated West purely to ""give people something to talk about"" during the COVID-19 pandemic and to ""get him off Kim's case"".
In January 2023, it was reported that West had informally married Australian architect Bianca Censori, who works for West's Yeezy brand, in a private ceremony in Beverly Hills. The ceremony had no legal standing; the couple did not file for a marriage license. In response to West's subsequent trips to Australia to visit Censori's family, Australian Minister for Education Jason Clare commented that West may be denied a visa due to his recent antisemitic remarks. The Executive Council of Australian Jewry and the Anti-Defamation Commission further argued against granting West entry.
Legal issues
He has been accused of the extensive use of uncleared samples in his music, leading to numerous lawsuits. In December 2006, Robert ""Evel"" Knievel sued the rapper for trademark infringement of his name and likeness in West's video for ""Touch the Sky"". Knievel took issue with the ""vulgar and offensive"" and ""sexually charged video"" in which West takes on the persona of ""Evel Kanyevel"" that Knievel claimed damaged his reputation. The suit sought monetary damages and an injunction to stop distribution of the video. West's attorneys argued that the music video amounted to satire and therefore was covered under the First Amendment. Days before his death in November 2007, Knievel amicably settled the suit after being paid a visit by West, saying, ""I thought he was a wonderful guy and quite a gentleman.""
In 2014, after an altercation with a paparazzo at the Los Angeles Airport, West was sentenced to serve two years' probation for a misdemeanor battery conviction, and was required to attend 24 anger management sessions, perform 250 hours of community service, and pay restitution to the photographer. A separate civil lawsuit brought by the paparazzo was settled in 2015, a week before it was due for trial. According to TMZ, an appeal to have West's conviction expunged from his criminal record was granted by a judge in 2016.
On June 29, 2022, a complaint was filed in U.S. District Court in New York claiming copyright infringement due to unauthorized use of a sample on the song ""Flowers"". The complaint claims that West sampled Marshall Jefferson's 1986 house track ""Move Your Body"" without gaining permission or providing compensation. In July 2022, West was sued for $416,000 by the fashion rental company the David Casavant Archive. The lawsuit claimed that West had failed to make payments on and return 13 rented pieces.
West was sued for wrongful termination, sexual harassment, and breach of contract by a former assistant in 2024. West denied the allegation. That same year, he was sued by a former model for sexual assault and strangulation. In the lawsuit, she claims that during a music video set, West choked and gagged her in the mouth.
Religious beliefs
After the success of his song ""Jesus Walks"" from the album The College Dropout, West was asked about his beliefs and said, ""I will say that I'm spiritual. I have accepted Jesus as my Savior. And I will say that I fall short every day."" In a 2008 interview with The Fader, West stated that ""I'm like a vessel, and God has chosen me to be the voice and the connector"". In a 2009 interview with online magazine Bossip, West stated that he believed in God, but at the time felt that he ""would never go into a religion"". In 2014, West referred to himself as a Christian during one of his concerts. Kim Kardashian stated in September 2019: ""He has had an amazing evolution of being born again and being saved by Christ."" In October 2019, West said with respect to his past, ""When I was trying to serve multiple gods it drove me crazy"" in reference to the ""god of ego, god of money, god of pride, the god of fame"", and that ""I didn't even know what it meant to be saved"" and that now ""I love Jesus Christ. I love Christianity.""
Politics
In September 2012, West donated $1,000 to Barack Obama's re-election campaign; further, in August 2015, West donated $2,700 to Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. He also donated $15,000 to the Democratic National Committee in October 2014. In December 2016, West met with President-elect Donald Trump to discuss bullying, supporting teachers, modernizing curriculums, and violence in Chicago. West subsequently stated he would have voted for Trump had he voted. In February 2017, however, West deleted all his tweets about Trump in purported dislike of the new president's policies, particularly the travel ban. West reiterated his support for Donald Trump in April 2018. In October 2018, West donated to progressive Chicago mayoral candidate Amara Enyia.
On June 29, 2024, he arrived in Moscow, Russia, to celebrate the 40th birthday of Russian fashion designer Gosha Rubchinskiy. West was labeled an ""enemy of Ukraine"" after his trip to Moscow.
Mental health
On November 19, 2016, West abruptly ended a concert before being committed at the recommendation of authorities to the UCLA Medical Center with hallucinations and paranoia. While the episode was first described as one of ""temporary psychosis"" caused by dehydration and sleep deprivation, West's mental state was abnormal enough for his 21 cancelled concerts to be covered by his insurance policy. He was reportedly paranoid and depressed throughout the hospitalization, but remained formally undiagnosed. Some have speculated that the Paris robbery of his wife may have triggered the paranoia. On November 30, West was released from the hospital.
In his song ""FML"" and his featured verse on Vic Mensa's song ""U Mad"", he refers to using the antidepressant medication Lexapro, and in his unreleased song ""I Feel Like That"", he mentions feeling many common symptoms of depression and anxiety. In a 2018 interview, West said that he had become addicted to opioids when they were prescribed to him after liposuction. The addiction may have contributed to his nervous breakdown in 2016. In addition to his opioid addiction, West has stated that he has had addictions to alcohol, sex, and pornography. West said that he often has suicidal ideation. West was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2016, though his diagnosis was not made public until his 2018 album Ye. He told President Donald Trump that it was a misdiagnosis. He had reportedly accepted the diagnosis again by 2019, but again suggested that it had been a misdiagnosis in 2022. In December 2022, he suggested that he may be autistic, and later said in February 2025 that he had received a professional diagnosis.
In August 2024, West's former Chief of Staff Milo Yiannopoulos stated in an affidavit filed to the California Dental Board that West was addicted to nitrous oxide. He alleged that dentist Thomas Connelly, who installed permanent titanium prosthodontics for West in January 2024, had moved into West's apartment building and was charging him $50,000 a month to supply the drugs.

Yancey's parents had musical backgrounds; his mother, Maureen ""Ma Dukes"" Yancey, is a former opera singer and his father, Beverly Dewitt Yancey, was a jazz bassist, and performed Globetrotters half-time shows for several years.At 5:10, mentioned by Ma Dukes.  Yancey's mother said that he could ""match pitch perfect harmony"" before he learned how to speak.
Along with a range of other musical genres, Yancey developed a passion for hip hop music. After transferring from Davis Aerospace Technical High School to Pershing High School, his classmates T3 and Baatin joined him in rap battles; the three later formed the rap group Slum Village. Yancey also took up beat-making using a simple tape deck as the center of his studio. In his teenage years, he ""stayed in the basement alone"" to train himself to produce beats with his growing record collection.

Early life
==========
Jones was born on August 9, 1982, in Atlanta, to James Clay Jones Jr. and Toni K. Broadus. In 1983, Jones and Broadus returned to their original home of Detroit, with their son after Jones was wounded in the line of duty serving as a police officer. They resided on the Eastside of Detroit with Jones' grandmother. In 1989, Jones' parents separated and his mother sent him and his younger sister to live with their father on Detroit's westside on Stahelin Hell Block near McNichols Road and the Southfield Freeway. Jones' love for music came to the forefront at the age of 12, when he performed in a middle school talent show and began writing his first raps shortly after. He attended high school at Detroit Cooley, and dropped out after the ninth grade. He got the name ""Boldy James"" from his friend, James Osely III, whom people in the neighborhood called ""Boldy"". Jones said, ""he didn't rap, he just sold cocaine. I liked the name because his name was James too"". When his friend was murdered, he decided to carry on with the name, using it to rap.

Early life
==========
Thebe Neruda Kgositsile was born on February 24, 1994, in Chicago, Illinois, to Cheryl Harris, a law professor and critical race theorist at the University of California, Los Angeles, and Keorapetse Kgositsile, a South African poet and political activist. Harris and Kgositsile separated when Thebe was six years old. His father is often mentioned in Kgositsile's music and was called a ""complicated figure"" by Pitchfork. He was presented as a person that was often absent in Kgositsile's life, due to him living in South Africa while Kgositsile lived in Los Angeles, California. Kgositsile stated that ""Me and my dad had a relationship that's not uncommon for people to have with their fathers, which is a non-perfect one, talking to him is symbolic and non-symbolic, but it's literally closure for my childhood. Not getting to have that moment left me to figure out a lot with my damn self."" Kgositsile attended the UCLA Lab School in Los Angeles and New Roads Middle School & High School in Santa Monica, California.


Artistry
========
Kgositsile has been called a ""hip-hop prodigy"" and in 2011, was branded by The New Yorker as ""the most exciting rapper to emerge in years, a virtuoso who was just starting to figure out what he could do with words."" He is characterized primarily by his voice, which has been classified as a ""deep baritone"".
Kgositsile has taken influence from MF Doom, Jay Z, J Dilla, Madlib, RZA, Lupe Fiasco, and Clipse.
Earl has been vocal about being a lyricist but instead using his abstract delivery of metaphors to show his artistry when it comes to his music.


Personal life
=============
Kgositsile currently lives in the neighborhood of Mid City, Los Angeles.
Kgositsile struggled with drug abuse, which was one of the reasons why his mother sent him to live in Samoa. The time in Samoa led to Kgositsile getting sober, although he relapsed upon returning to the United States. Kgositsile attributes his drug abuse to time with his collective Odd Future and leaving a long-term relationship, saying he was often smoking marijuana and drinking lean before quitting as he reached adulthood.
Kgositsile was raised as a Nichiren Buddhist and, after a period away from the belief system, he said that he had returned to the religion in 2016.
Since August 2022, Kgositsile has been in a relationship with actress, writer and comedian Aida Osman.

================


Early life
==========
Jacques Bermon Webster II was born on April 30, 1991, in Houston, Texas. From ages one through six, Webster lived with his grandmother in South Park, Houston. The neighborhood was notorious for crime and had an impact on a young Webster, ""Growing up, my grandmother stayed in the 'hood so I seen random crazy shit. [I saw] mad bums and crazy spazzed out motherfuckers, I saw people looking weird, hungry, and grimey. I was always like, 'I gotta get the fuck out this shit.' It gave me my edge—[it made me] who I am right now.""
Webster moved to Missouri City, a middle-class suburban area bordering southwest Houston, to live with his parents. His mother worked for Apple and his father ran his own business. Webster's father is also a soul musician and his grandfather was a jazz composer. Webster attended Elkins High School and graduated at seventeen. During high school, he participated in musical theater. Webster then attended the University of Texas at San Antonio, before dropping out his second year to fully pursue his music career.
During an interview, Webster revealed he chose his moniker as a combination of his favorite uncle, Travis, and the first name of one of his biggest inspirations, Kid Cudi (whose real name is Scott Mescudi).

Influences
thumb|250px|Scott performing in 2017
Scott has stated that Björk is ""one of my biggest inspirations for why I do what I do"". He is also influenced by Bon Iver, Kid Cudi, M.I.A., Kanye West, Toro y Moi, Tame Impala, T.I., and Thom Yorke.
Musical style
Scott makes heavy use of audio manipulation effects such as Auto-Tune, phasing, delays, and stereo-sculpted chorusing and harmony structures, predominantly influenced by producers Mike Dean and Alex Tumay. Scott's musical style has been characterized as ""ambient""; Scott himself has said ""I'm not hip-hop"". Vulture described Scott's sound as ""unremittingly dark, syncretic, hi-res, and above all unnatural"". Scott's musical style has been described as being hip-hop, ""psychedelic"" trap, and pop rap. Spin magazine compared his debut mixtape Owl Pharaoh (2013) to fellow American rapper Kid Cudi's Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager (2010).


Personal life
=============
Scott began dating media personality and businesswoman Kylie Jenner in April 2017. In February 2018, Jenner gave birth to their daughter. Jenner appeared in the music video for ""Stop Trying to Be God"", from Scott's third studio album Astroworld. They broke up in September 2019, but quarantined together during the COVID-19 pandemic for the sake of their daughter and ended up rekindling their relationship. On September 7, 2021, after weeks of speculation, Jenner revealed that she and Scott were expecting their second child. Jenner gave birth to their son in February 2022. The couple separated for a second time by January 2023.

Early life
==========
McCollum was born in Mableton, Georgia. He attended Alabama State University in fall 2015 but soon dropped out to pursue his musical career. He adopted the name ""Yachty"" and moved from his hometown of Atlanta to New York City to launch his career. In New York, he lived with a friend and networked with online street fashion personalities, while he built up his own Instagram following. He worked at McDonald's to supplement his income early in his career.

2022 SafeMoon lawsuit
On February 18, 2022, in a class-action lawsuit filed against the cryptocurrency company SafeMoon that alleged the company is a pump-and-dump scheme, McCollum was named as a defendant along with professional boxer Jake Paul, musician Nick Carter, rapper Soulja Boy, and social media personality Ben Phillips for promoting the SafeMoon token on their social media accounts with misleading information. On the same day, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a lawsuit against Bitconnect that the Securities Act of 1933 extends to targeted solicitation using social media.

Personal life
=============
The majority of Staples' family are immigrants from Haiti, who had first arrived in Eastern Canada, then left for Louisiana believing that they could buy land cheaper but were unaware of the social economic climate there at the time. Growing up, Staples spent a lot of time with his maternal grandfather, Andrew Hutchins, a retired truck driver and construction worker who was a young boy when he arrived in the United States. He met Staples' grandmother at the age of sixteen and left to join the army to help support his family. When Hutchins came back, he became a diehard Dodgers fan who decided to migrate to Compton because he saw an interview of star player, Duke Snider, who mentioned he lived in Compton, which was a nice area at the time.
Staples lives in Southern California and is a fan of the Los Angeles Clippers. He is a fan of modern art and has referenced the French-American sculptor Louise Bourgeois in his song ""Rain Come Down"" and stated his appreciation for painter and photographer Richard Prince.
Staples has stated that he follows a straight edge lifestyle and does not drink alcohol or take illicit drugs.

Jermaine Lamarr Cole was born on January 28, 1985, at an American military base in Frankfurt, West Germany. His father is an African American veteran, who served in the US Army, and his mother, Kay, born in Michigan, is a white American who was a postal worker for the United States Postal Service. Cole's father later abandoned the family during his youth. At the age of eight months his mother moved with him and his older brother Zach to the United States, to Fayetteville, North Carolina. Cole grew up in a multi-ethnic environment, and when asked about how closely his ethnicity impacts him, Cole commented, ""I can identify with white people, because I know my mother, her side of the family, who I love. But at the end of the day, [I've] never felt white. I can identify [with white people] but never have I felt like I'm one of them. I identify more with what I look like, because that's how I got treated [but] not necessarily in a negative way."" During his youth, Cole expressed an affinity for basketball and music, and served as a first-chair violinist for the Terry Sanford Orchestra until 2003.
Cole began rapping at the age of twelve, and saw it as an ideal profession in 2000, when his mother purchased an ASR-X musical sampler as a Christmas gift. During this period, Cole heightened emphasis on improving his production skills, later beginning initial production under the pseudonym Therapist. Cole later collaborated with local group Bomm Sheltuh, rapping and producing as a member of the group. Cole can be seen in the crowd of the 2006 documentary Dave Chappelle's Block Party.
Upon graduating high school with a 4.2 GPA, Cole decided that his chances of securing a recording contract would be better in New York City. He moved there and accepted a scholarship to St. John's University. Initially majoring in computer science, Cole later switched to communications after witnessing the life of a lonely computer science professor. At the college, Cole was the president of Haraya, a pan-African student coalition. He graduated magna cum laude in 2007, with a 3.8 GPA.Stephanie Wash (September 19, 2009). Jay-Z Protege J.

Early life
==========
Denzel Rae Don Curry was born on February 16, 1995, in the Carol City neighborhood of Miami Gardens, Florida. Curry started down an artist's path with early poetic ambitions in elementary school before he began rapping in the sixth grade. His time was spent at a local Boys & Girls Clubs of America chapter where he challenged others to rap battles. He attended Miami's Design and Architecture High School for two years before being expelled. Curry then attended Miami Carol City Senior High School, where he started working on Nostalgic 64 while still attending class. In a 2018 interview with The Breakfast Club, Curry disclosed that he was molested by an unnamed older man during his childhood.


Artistry
========
Curry's music is influenced by a variety of artists, genres, and art forms. Some of his greatest sources of inspiration are anime, video games, and martial arts. Some musicians who have been credited with inspiring Curry include MF Doom, André 3000, DMX, Kanye West, the Roots, Kid Cudi, Nirvana, and Trick Daddy, as well as Southern hip hop in general.
Curry is best known for his aggressive, raw sound, ""gritty"" lyricism, and high-energy music, but also praised for his versatility. He has been acknowledged as a figure who ""helped pioneer"" SoundCloud rap and called ""an artist who pushes the boundaries of [hip hop]"".


Personal life
=============
On February 27, 2014, Curry's brother, Treon ""Tree"" Johnson, died as a result of complications after being tased by the police in Hialeah, Florida. Officers responded to an emergency call made by a man claiming that Johnson was beating two dogs with a metal pipe. Officers then employed physical force, pepper spray, and a taser in an attempt to restrain Johnson. He succumbed to his wounds, and he ultimately died after being transported to Jackson Memorial Hospital. His family argued that the incident was a case of police brutality. Curry has spoken about Johnson's death and police brutality in interviews and in his music. One example of this is the lyric ""Cops killing' blacks when the whites do the most,"" in his song ""The Last."" He has also inculcated upon this theme in his cover of ""Bulls on Parade"" by Rage Against the Machine.
In 2022, Curry signed onto the Musicians For Palestine pledge, refusing to perform in Israel following the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis. In November 2023, Curry signed an open letter calling for a ceasefire in the 2023 Israel–Hamas war and an end to the blockade of the Gaza Strip.
In January 2021, Curry discovered that he is related to St. Louis rapper Smino through the discovery of a shared uncle.

Early life
==========
Christopher Brent Wood was born on September 19, 1995, in Columbia, Maryland. His father is of Dominican ancestry, while his mother is African-American. Faiyaz stated in an interview with Billboard, that at the age of six, he was gifted his first play keyboard, leading to him ""falling in love"" with music. He started producting music at the age of twelve and sold beats to older kids to make money. He often listened to hip-hop after his brother recommended he listen to Ginuwine and Timbaland; he started listening to R&B when he reached high school. Faiyaz attended Long Reach High School, where he graduated at 17. His parents were not always understanding of his dreams as a musician; which Faiyaz said was warranted because his love for music ""always distracted"" him from school, resulting in his grades being consistently low. In an interview with Vogue, he said: ""I was messing up on every other level in my life growing up—whether it was in school or in my jobs"". Shortly after graduating, Faiyaz and his family moved to Charlotte, North Carolina. Faiyaz was skeptical about the move initially but soon realized it would only be beneficial and increase his work ethic. Faiyaz revealed to GQ that at the age of eighteen, he moved out of his parents' house because they didn't support his music dreams: ""I moved out at 18 because my people got tired of me making so much noise with my recording. My father didn’t like that shit so I had to go. I had to thug it"". In 2014, Faiyaz moved to Los Angeles, California, to pursue his music career.


Artistry
========
Influences
Faiyaz has referred to Lauryn Hill as his biggest influence. When speaking to Fact, Faiyaz stated ""It was Lauryn Hill who inspired me to start singing from early on"". In an interview with Wonderland, Faiyaz revealed that his earliest memory of music was seeing The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill CD on his fireplace during his childhood. He stated that the album has a ""seamless blend of R&B and Hip-Hop that became one"", noting that it gave him the excuse to follow suit. He's also cited Aaliyah, Currensy, Curtis Mayfield, Gil Scott-Heron, Jeff Buckley, Radiohead, and Tupac Shakur as some of his inspirations.
Musical style
Faiyaz's music often covers the topics of ""infidelity, breakups, and oversharing"", resulting in several publications labeling Faiyaz—alongside other artists—a ""toxic king"". When interviewed on The Angie Martinez Show, Faiyaz said: ""I'm inspired by real life"". In an interview with Complex, Faiyaz stated that he listens ""to a lot of different types of genres,"" however, he noted that he's an R&B artist because he's ""Black, I sing, and I have a soulful voice."" Describing his versatility, Faiyaz stated, ""I might fuck around and make a reggae album tomorrow.""
His earlier songs from his Black Child EP consisted of predominantly Rap music. In particular, Faiyaz specialized in trap soul music, however, as he grew as an artist, he began to ease into his R&B side, allowing elements of hip-hop into his music. Faiyaz stated that music is a form of therapy for him, noting that it's the main reason his music is as deep and as personal as it comes off as. He noted that he ""write[s] a lot"" and that his writing consists of poetry, day-to-day notes, and music, however, sometimes, he ""can go into the studio and not write at all."" In an interview with Rolling Stone, Faiyaz stated that he's comfortable recording music wherever he is, stating that he ""catch[es] a vibe just naturally"". He stated that he gets ""stuck on records for a long period of time"", leaving him to ""sit on it for a little bit"". He described his recording process as ""very long and drawn-out"", noting that that's the primary reason why he takes as long as he does to release his music. Faiyaz has stated that his writing is the most important part of his recording process to him, noting that, ""for me, it’s something different when it comes to lyrics. I think that it touches on when a song moves past just music, in terms of the literature"". When asked how he'd describe himself as an artist, Faiyaz expressed that he ""just put[s] together what [he feels is] a good body of work and what [he] wanted to create and the story [he] wanted to tell"".

Early life
==========
Mach-Hommy was raised predominantly in Newark, New Jersey, but also spent much of his childhood in Port-au-Prince. His father was a folk guitarist, and Mach credits his father's musical style as an influence on his own. The first music Mach recorded was at the age of 13, when he performed a freestyle over the beat to Raekwon's ""Verbal Intercourse"".
In his early career, Mach found the music recording process to be an ""unhealthy"" environment and sought to take up filmmaking instead. However, at the encouragement of several Griselda members, he performed a verse for the song ""Beloved"", which motivated him to begin rapping again.


Personal life
=============
In an interview with Billboard, Mach stated that he speaks every Romance language. He is also an avid fisher and hunter.

================


Early life
==========
Billy Woods was born in Washington, D.C. His mother was an English literature professor from Jamaica, and his father was a Marxist intellectual from Zimbabwe; the two met while Woods' father was pursuing a Ph.D. in the United States. During the Zimbabwe War of Independence, Woods' father lived in ""political exile"", but in 1980 the family moved to Zimbabwe and Woods' father entered the Zimbabwean government. Later in the 1980s, Woods' father died. Around a year and a half later, in 1989, Woods and his mother returned to the United States and moved to Washington D.C. Woods briefly attended Howard University before getting involved in New York's hip-hop scene. He started making music in the late 1990s, writing his ""first real rhyme"" at a laundromat in Kennebunk, Maine in 1997.
""Billy Woods"" is a pseudonym and his birth name has never been revealed. In an interview with Jacobin, Woods explained that his pursuit of anonymity was rooted in several reasons, including his desires to remain a private individual and to avoid being associated with his family name.

Early life
==========
Abel Makkonen Tesfaye was born on February 16, 1990, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The only child of Ethiopian Amhara immigrants Makkonen Tesfaye and Samrawit Hailu, who separated shortly after his birth, he was raised in the suburb of Scarborough by his mother and grandmother. Tesfaye's patronymic is spelled ""Makkonen"" instead of the traditional Ethiopian name ""Makonnen"". The similarity with the Finnish surname Makkonen is pure coincidence. The spelling of Tesfaye's patronymic might be the result of a typographic error or a new form of the traditional name. Tesfaye is proficient in Amharic, his native language acquired from his grandmother, and is also fluent in French, as he attended a French immersion school. He was further educated at West Hill Collegiate Institute and Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute.
At seventeen, Tesfaye dropped out of school and relocated to an apartment in the neighbourhood of Parkdale with two friends, one of whom is La Mar Taylor—his best friend and now creative director. Living a hedonistic lifestyle with his friends, Tesfaye adopted his stage name because he left home on a weekend. He removed the last 'e' in 'weekend' to avoid trademark issues with the Canadian pop rock band the Weekend. He has also experienced homelessness and was incarcerated on several occasions during this time, which encouraged him to ""smarten up, to focus"". During this time, Tesfaye frequently engaged in drug use, including substances such as ketamine, cocaine, MDMA, magic mushrooms, and cough syrup, stating that drugs were a ""crutch"" for him when he wrote music. Before releasing music under his current stage name, he went under the alias ""Kin Kane"", as part of a hip-hop duo called ""Bulleez n Nerdz"", and was part of a production team called 'the Noise'.


Artistry
========
Influences
Tesfaye cites Michael Jackson, Prince, and R. Kelly as his main musical inspirations. He has attributed Jackson's music as key in spurring him to be a singer, referencing the lyrics to ""Dirty Diana"" as an example. His high-flying vocal style was influenced by Ethiopian singers such as Aster Aweke. He grew up listening to a variety of music genres, including soul, hip hop, funk, indie rock, and post-punk. Tesfaye is heavily influenced by 1980s music, and credits the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (2002) for ""opening my eyes"" to the music of that era. ""I've always had an admiration for the era before I was born"", he said in an interview for Billboard. ""You can hear it as far back as my first mixtape that the '80s – Siouxsie and the Banshees, Cocteau Twins – play such a huge role in my sound.""
Tesfaye has named Deftones as one of his influences during the making of House of Balloons, Thursday and Echoes of Silence. He has also cited Lana Del Rey, David Bowie, the Smiths, Bad Brains, Talking Heads, DeBarge, 50 Cent, Wu-Tang Clan, and Eminem as influences and inspirations. When Daft Punk announced their split in 2021, Tesfaye praised them during an interview with Variety, saying: ""Those guys are one of the reasons I make music, so I can't even compare them to other people...""
Production and songwriting
Tesfaye's songs are ""built around a fogged, crepuscular production"", and feature slow tempos, rumbling bass, and forlorn echoes. His music incorporates samples that are unconventional in R&B production, including punk, shoegaze, dream pop and alternative rock. Marc Hogan of Spin says that Tesfaye's samples tend ""to draw from rock critic-approved sources, though generally ones that already share elements of his sexual menace"", sampling artists such as Beach House, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Aaliyah. Tesfaye worked mostly with producers Illangelo and Doc McKinney, whom Ian Cohen of Pitchfork credits with developing ""a state-of-the-art R&B template"" with the artist. In concert, Tesfaye reappropriates his digitized productions with a suite-like arena rock aesthetic.
His emotional, plaintive lyrics often express feelings of hurt and deal with subject matter such as sex, drugs, and partying; this is seen especially in After Hours and House of Balloons. Hermione Hoby of The Guardian characterizes Tesfaye's songs as ""narcotised-slow jams"" and delineates their message as ""partying is an existential experience, sex is fraught with alienation, and everything registers as unreal and unsettling."" Paul MacInnes of The Guardian stated that he views Tesfaye's three mixtapes as ""a rough trajectory of party, after-party and hangover."" Anupa Mistry of the Toronto Standard observes throughout his mixtapes a ""cast of supine, stoned zombie-women... whose legs willingly part after being plied with substances and who morph into threats only when [he is] coming down and feeling vulnerable."" Tesfaye has stated that by singing vulgar, ignorant lyrics in an elegant, sexy way, he is ""paying homage to R Kelly, and even Prince to a certain extent.""
Voice and music style
Tesfaye often sings in a falsetto register. J. D. Considine finds his singing's ""tremulous quality"" similar to Michael Jackson, but writes that he eschews Jackson's ""strong basis in the blues"" for a more Arabic-influenced melisma. Tesfaye possesses a wide light-lyric tenor vocal range, which spans over three octaves. His vocal range reaches its extreme low at the bass F (F2), and its peak high at the tenor G (G5), with a natural tessitura within the upper fourth octave. Tesfaye often makes use of his head voice to build resonance to belt out strong high notes within the fifth octave. Tesfaye's vocals have a recognizable Ethiopian characteristic. Hannah Giogis of Pitchfork notes that ""his trademark vibrato, the characteristically pained whine that pervades much of Tesfaye's music, draws from a long Ethiopian musical legacy of tortured pining. Imbuing our voices with the shaky pain of loss—romantic or otherwise—is a hallmark of Ethiopian musical tradition. Tesfaye, with his staccato wails and aching nostalgia, is a young, North American addition to a dynasty of melodramatic Ethiopian singers."" In 2023, Rolling Stone ranked the Weeknd at number 110 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.
Tesfaye's discography spans pop, R&B, hip hop, dance, alternative and new wave genres. His work is generally categorized as alternative R&B, due to his contributions in broadening the genre's musical palette to incorporate indie and electronic styles. Mistry writes that he ""will be obsequiously praised as the future of R&B music—because Tesfaye is a black singer, not because he's making quantifiable, canonical R&B."" Tesfaye shared his thoughts on the primary label during an interview with Time in 2015, stating: ""Alternative R&B is in my soul. It's not going anywhere. When I put out songs from House of Balloons in 2010, people said I made R&B cool again. I'm assuming that's when the label was created. I feel honored that a good part of today's music is inspired by it, consciously or subconsciously. The only way I could have done that was to be ambitious and grand."" Tesfaye's first three mixtapes; House of Balloons, Thursday and Echoes of Silence, are alternative R&B projects that draw on dream pop, post-punk and trip hop, amongst others. His debut studio album Kiss Land is categorized as R&B and dark wave. His next three albums, Beauty Behind the Madness, Starboy and After Hours, are considered R&B and pop; with Starboy utilizing heavy trap influences, and After Hours drawing on new wave and dream pop influences. Tesfaye's fifth studio album Dawn FM explores dance-pop and synth-pop genres.


Personal life
=============
Tesfaye prefers to keep his personal life out of the public eye. In the beginning of his career, he refrained from participating in interviews and instead chose to communicate via Twitter, which he attributed to shyness and insecurities. He prefers to be interviewed only in rare situations. Tesfaye was raised as an Ethiopian Orthodox. When asked whether or not he was still religious, he stated to Variety in 2020, ""I dunno...everything is a test, and if you are religious or spiritual, you have to go through things.""
From April 2015 to August 2019, Tesfaye was in an on-again, off-again relationship with American model Bella Hadid. She starred in the music video for his single ""In the Night"" in December 2015. He dated American singer-actress Selena Gomez from January to October 2017. Both of the relationships received widespread media attention, and were the topic of tabloid speculation. Tesfaye has been in a relationship with Saudi-born disc jockey Simi Khadra since February 2022; publications have noted that unlike his previous romances, he has kept his relationship with Khadra private from the press.
Tesfaye's hairstyle, which has been described as one of his most recognizable traits, has been claimed to be partly inspired by American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. He began growing it out in 2011 and remarked at how easy it was to maintain with ""a hard shampoo every once in a while"". He cut his hair in 2016, prior to the release of Starboy. On social media, Tesfaye typically suffixed his first name with ""xo"", which is often used as an emoticon for hugs and kisses. According to The Guardian Hermione Hoby, this was his intention, though others believe it was a reference to his recreational use of ecstasy and oxycodone. He later altered the handles on his social media to reflect his stage name in preparation for the release of Starboy. In August 2021, during a cover story with GQ, he described himself as being ""sober lite"", meaning that he has stopped using drugs with the exception of marijuana. He also noted that he drinks alcohol occasionally, stating: ""I'm not a heavy drinker, as much as I used to be. The romance of drinking isn't there.""
In January 2015, Tesfaye was arrested for allegedly punching a police officer in Las Vegas after being taken into an elevator to break up a fight. He pleaded no contest and was sentenced to complete fifty hours of community service.
As of August 2021, Tesfaye was residing in Bel Air, Los Angeles. In 2017, he purchased a home in Hidden Hills, California for $18.5 million, which he sold to Madonna in 2021 for $19.3 million. Tesfaye previously lived in penthouses in Westwood, Los Angeles and New York City.
In April 2023, Tesfaye revealed that he has ADHD.

Early life
==========

The 18-year-old dropped out of school and moved to New York City as an attempt to develop his music career.D'Angelo: Biography. NME. Retrieved January 28, 2009. The group previously enjoyed some notice in Richmond, evenly dividing their repertoire between soul covers and originals while D'Angelo accumulated compositions of his own and developed his songwriting skills. The group's turnout on Amateur Night resulted in three consecutive wins and cash prize,Samuels, Allison. Pop Music: A One-Man Soul Revival. Newsweek. Retrieved January 28, 2009. and upon returning home to Richmond, D'Angelo was inspired to produce an album and began composing material. This took place after a brief tenure as a member of the hip hop group I.D.U. (Intelligent, Deadly but Unique).H.W. Wilson Co. (2001), pp. 36–39.


Personal life

Early life
==========
Erica Abi Wright was born in Dallas, Texas. Her mother raised her, her brother Eevin, and her sister alone after separating from their father, William Wright Jr. The children's maternal and paternal grandmothers often helped look after them. Badu began singing and dancing at the age of four at the Dallas Theater Center and The Black Academy of Arts and Letters (TBAAL) under the guidance of her godmother, Gwen Hargrove, and uncle TBAAL founder Curtis King.
By the age of 14, Badu was freestyling for a local radio station alongside artists such as Roy Hargrove. In her youth, she had decided to change the spelling of her first name from Erica to Erykah, as she believed her original name was a ""slave name"". The term ""kah"" signifies the inner self. She adopted the surname ""Badu"" because it is her favorite jazz scat sound; also, among the Akan people in Ghana, it is the term for the 10th-born child.
After graduating from Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, Badu went on to study theater at Grambling State University, a historically black university. She left the university in 1993 before graduating, to focus more fully on music.  During this time, Badu took several minimum-wage jobs to support herself. She taught drama and dance to children at the South Dallas Cultural Center. Working and touring with her cousin, Robert ""Free"" Bradford, she recorded a 19-song demo, Country Cousins, which attracted the attention of Kedar Massenburg. He set Badu up to record a duet with D'Angelo, ""Your Precious Love"", and eventually signed her to a record deal with Universal Records.


Personal life
=============
Badu became a vegan in 2006: ""Vegan food is soul food in its truest form. Soul food means to feed the soul. And to me, your soul is your intent. If your intent is pure, you are pure."" Badu splits her time between her hometown and Fort Greene, New York.
In 1996, Badu became involved with rapper André 3000 of OutKast, with whom she had her first child, a son named Seven Sirius Benjamin, on November 18, 1997. Their relationship ended in 1999. In late 2000, OutKast released the song ""Ms. Jackson"", which was inspired by André 3000's then relationship with Badu and her mother. The song reached number one on Billboard Hot 100 and would go on to win a Grammy Award.
On July 5, 2004, Badu gave birth to a daughter, Puma Sabti Curry; Puma's father is Texas-based rapper The D.O.C. On February 1, 2009, Badu gave birth to her third child, a girl named Mars Merkaba Thedford, with her boyfriend of five years, rapper Jay Electronica.
For the 2014 Okayplayer platform and web television OkayAfrica TV, Badu had her DNA tested, and genealogists researched her family ancestry. It was revealed that Badu's mitochondrial DNA traced to the Bamileke people of Cameroon in Central Africa.

Personal life
=============
In 2017, Cottrill began attending Syracuse University, studying in the Bandier Program for Recording and Entertainment Industries, but dropped out after one year to pursue music full time. Bandier program director Bill Werde encouraged Cottrill to take time off, calling it a ""rare opportunity.""
Cottrill was diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis at the age of 17.
After the success of ""Pretty Girl"", a number of social media users (specifically on discussion website Reddit) began claiming that Clairo was an ""industry plant"" who gained success through her father's nepotism. She denied the claims, calling them sexist. Writers for The Guardian and The Ringer also stated that her father's connections facilitated their record contract signing. In 2021, she spoke openly about the accusations, telling Rolling Stone, ""I definitely am not blind to the fact that things have been easier for me than other people's experiences. It would be stupid of me to not acknowledge the privilege I had from the start to be able to sign somewhere where there's trust, to be able to sign a record deal that doesn't revolve around keeping myself afloat financially.""
Cottrill came out as bisexual to her fans via Twitter in May 2018. In an interview, she explained that making friends in college is what helped her to come out, as her friends  were openly gay and she was inspired by ""their confidence and their willingness to be exposed.""

Nasir bin Olu Dara Jones was born in the Brooklyn borough of New York City on September 14, 1973, to African American parents. His father, Olu Dara (born Charles Jones III), is a jazz and blues musician from Mississippi. His mother, Fannie Ann (née Little; 1941–2002) was a U.S. Postal Service worker from North Carolina.Stated on Finding Your Roots, PBS, October 28, 2014 He has a brother, Jabari Fret, who raps under the name Jungle and is a member of hip-hop group Bravehearts. His father adopted the name ""Olu Dara"" from the Yoruba people. ""Nasir"" is an Arabic name meaning ""helper and protector"", while ""bin"" means ""son of"" in Arabic. He is a cousin of actors Yara Shahidi and Sayeed Shahidi.
As a young child, Nas and his family relocated to the Queensbridge housing project of the Long Island City community area in the borough of Queens. His neighbor, Willie ""Ill Will"" Graham, influenced his interest in hip-hop by playing him records. His parents divorced in 1985, and he dropped out of school after the eighth grade. He educated himself about African culture through the Five-Percent Nation (a splinter group of the Nation of Islam) and the Nuwaubian Nation. In his early years, he played the trumpet and began writing his own rhymes.Jackson, Margaret. ""Nas"". Grove Music Online. (January 2014): 1. Oxford Music Online. Web. February 21, 2015.


Artistry
========
Nas has been praised for his ability to create a ""devastating match between lyrics and production"" by journalist Peter Shapiro, as well as creating a ""potent evocation of life on the street"", and he has even been compared to Rakim for his lyrical technique. In his book Book of Rhymes: The Poetics of Hip Hop (2009), writer Adam Bradley states, ""Nas is perhaps contemporary rap's greatest innovator in storytelling. His catalog includes songs narrated before birth ('Fetus') and after death ('Amongst Kings'), biographies ('UBR [Unauthorized Biography of Rakim]') and autobiographies ('Doo Rags'), allegorical tales ('Money Is My Bitch') and epistolary ones ('One Love'), he's rapped in the voice of a woman ('Sekou Story') and even of a gun ('I Gave You Power')."" Robert Christgau writes that ""Nas has been transfiguring [gangsta rap] since Illmatic"". Kool Moe Dee notes that Nas has an ""off-beat conversational flow"" in his book There's a God on the Mic – he says: ""before Nas, every MC focused on rhyming with a cadence that ultimately put the words that rhymed on beat with the snare drum. Nas created a style of rapping that was more conversational than ever before"".
OC of D.I.T.C. comments in the book How to Rap: ""Nas did the song backwards ['Rewind']... that was a brilliant idea"". Also in How to Rap, 2Mex of The Visionaries describes Nas's flow as ""effervescent"", Rah Digga says Nas's lyrics have ""intricacy"", Bootie Brown of The Pharcyde explains that Nas does not always have to make words rhyme as he is ""charismatic"", and Nas is also described as having a ""densely packed"" flow, with compound rhymes that ""run over from one beat into the next or even into another bar"".
On March 15, 2012, Nas became the first rapper to have a personal verified account on Genius, where he explains his own lyrics and occasionally comments on lyrics from other rappers he admires.
About.com ranked him 1st on their list of the ""50 Greatest MCs of All Time"" in 2014, and a year later, Nas was featured on the ""10 Best Rappers of All Time"" list by Billboard. The Source ranked him No. 2 on their list of the Top 50 Lyricists of All Time. In 2013, Nas was ranked fourth on MTV's ""Hottest MCs in the Game"" list. His debut, Illmatic, is widely considered among the greatest hip-hop albums of all time.
In July 2013, Harvard University established the Nasir Jones Hip-Hop Fellowship as part of the Hip-Hop Archives and W. E. B. Du Bois Research Institute, to fund scholars and artists who show potential and creativity in the arts in connection to hip-hop. On November 12, 2019, Nas was honored by Haute Living, along with Watches of Switzerland and Hennessy, in a celebratory affair that included a violin rendition of iconic Nas songs performed by Edward W. Hardy.


Personal life
=============
Nas is a spokesperson and mentor for P'Tones Records, a non-profit after-school music program with the mission ""to create constructive opportunities for urban youth through no-cost music programs.""
Nas grew up in a Christian Southern Baptist family, and while not directly affiliated with any religious denomination, believes there to be a higher power.
Nas is a fan of his hometown baseball team the New York Mets and English soccer team Everton F.C.
Relationships and family
In the spring of 2002, Nas lost his mother to cancer. She died in his arms.
On June 15, 1994, Nas's ex-fiancée, Carmen Bryan, gave birth to their daughter, Destiny.
In January 2005, Nas married R&B singer Kelis in Atlanta after a two-year relationship. On April 30, 2009, a spokesperson confirmed that Kelis filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. Kelis gave birth to Nas's first son on July 21, 2009. Nas announced the birth of his son, Knight, at a gig in Queens, New York, against Kelis's wishes. The birth was also announced by Nas via an online video. The couple's divorce was finalized on May 21, 2010. Their divorce was visually reflected in Nas' song, ""Bye Baby"", and in the music video with him holding his ex-wife's green wedding dress in a black leather chair, which would also be the backdrop of the album cover for Life Is Good (2012). In 2018, Kelis accused Nas of being physically and mentally abusive during their marriage. Nas replied to the accusations on social media, accusing Kelis of attempting to slander him in the time of a custody battle and accusing Kelis of abusing his daughter, Destiny.
Nas briefly dated Mary J. Blige and Nicki Minaj.
In an October 2014 episode of PBS's Finding Your Roots, Nas learned about five generations of his ancestry. His great-great-great-grandmother, Pocahontas Little, was an enslaved woman who was sold for $830. When host Henry Louis Gates showed Nas her bill of sale and told him more about the man who bought her, Nas remarked that he is considering buying the land where the slave owner lived. Nas was also shown the marriage certificate of his great-great-great-grandmother, Pocahontas, and great-great-great-grandfather, Calvin.

================


Early life
==========
Polachek was born in Manhattan, New York City, on June 20, 1985, to James Montel Polachek (1944–2020), a scholar in Chinese history and trained classical musician, and Elizabeth Allan. Her father is of Ashkenazi Jewish-Ukrainian descent, while her mother has Scottish and English ancestry. Her family relocated to Tokyo, Japan, where she lived between the ages of one and six, and later settled in Greenwich, Connecticut, where Polachek started singing choir in the third grade. She was a synthesizer player from a young age as her father gave her a Yamaha keyboard to dissuade her from being disruptive on the piano.
Polachek's parents divorced in 1994. She describes herself as ""a very hyperactive kid"" and said that they would play Enya at their respective houses to calm her senses. Polachek recounts her early exposure to traditional Japanese songs and anime themes as being influential on her musical education. She rode horses growing up. As a teenager, she began traveling to New York to attend concerts, which were a mix of post-hardcore emo, DIY punk, and jazz shows. Mike Patton of Faith No More once personally walked her into a show at the Knitting Factory when her fake ID was rejected. She played in a couple of bands in high school and college.


Artistry
========
Musical style
Polachek's musical style has been described as mainly alternative pop, along with art pop, indie pop, experimental pop, and avant-pop. Shaad D'Souza of The Guardian wrote: ""Before 'Running Up That Hill' returned to the charts, Polachek was shaping up to be something like Gen Z's Kate Bush – a producer and vocalist interested in music that's formally eccentric and unapologetic about her own too much-ness.""
Influences
Polachek's influences have been described as ""eclectic"" by music critics. When asked about her earliest musical influence by Interview, she responded that it was ""probably Enya"". Growing up in Japan until the age of six, she was exposed to traditional Japanese songs and anime themes, which she says were influential on her musical education; she stated that Japanese singing consists of ""a lot of minor and pentatonic [tonality], with really angular melodies that I think really stuck in my subconscious"". She named Mishio Ogawa in particular as ""one of [her] biggest influences"". Other vocal influences include Celine Dion and Matia Bazar's song ""Ti sento"". She also credits riding horses as a child with helping her ""[learn] a lot about rhythm and about voice"".
Polachek says that she ""grew up kneeling at the altar of alternative music"" and that Björk, Kate Bush, and Fiona Apple were her ""absolute heroes"" when she was a teenager. Her alter ego Ramona Lisa was inspired by ""artists whose looks were inseparable from their music"", such as Nirvana, Marilyn Manson, and David Bowie. She named those artists, along with Björk and Busta Rhymes, as influences for her visual identity. She called Paddy McAloon of Prefab Sprout her ""favorite lyricist"" and stated that she is ""very inspired by contemporary artists like Rosalía or Doja Cat, who play with sounds"". She also finds inspiration in ""more abstract"" domains beyond music, such as landscapes; in a 2024 interview with Out, she named swallows as her musical soulmates.
Polachek also named Kittie as one of her influences for her ""straight-up grunge"" song, ""Starburned and Unkissed"".
Musical collaborations
In 2008, Polachek formed Girl Crisis choir with twelve other female singers, including members of Au Revoir Simone and Class Actress. The modular group arranged and recorded two cover versions a year from 2008 to 2013, including songs by Black Sabbath, Nirvana, Leonard Cohen, the Bangles, and Ace of Base.
In 2010, Polachek joined Jorge Elbrecht of Brooklyn-based Violens to record a ""sgin"" of Justin Bieber's ""Never Let You Go"": ""We went on YouTube to find a video among the highest ranks of hits, and came across 'Never Let You Go'. We went on to make what we call a 'sgin' (anagram of the word 'sing')—an original song written specifically to synch into someone else's video on mute"". The same year, she also recorded a duet with Violens, ""Violent Sensation Descends (French Duet Version)"". She later shot and directed the music video for the band's song ""It Couldn't Be Perceived"" in 2011. She collaborated with Elbrecht again on the EP Gloss Coma 001 in 2013, which includes the single ""I.V. Aided Dreams"".
In 2012, Polachek featured on the song ""Everything Is Spoilt by Use"" by Ice Choir, a solo project by Kurt Feldman of the Pains of Being Pure at Heart; she also directed and edited the song's music video. Polachek collaborated with Blood Orange on the tracks ""Chamakay"" in 2013 and ""Holy Will"" in 2018. In 2013, she co-wrote and co-produced ""No Angel"", which was featured on Beyoncé's critically acclaimed fifth studio album Beyoncé. Due to her production and engineering work on the song, Beyoncés nomination for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the 57th ceremony included Polachek. In 2013, she also contributed vocals to ""Unhold"" by the Spanish alternative-dance band Delorean.
Polachek featured on Danny L Harle's single ""Ashes of Love"" in 2016. In 2017, she appeared on two songs from Charli XCX's mixtape Pop 2: as a featured artist on ""Tears"" and as a backing vocalist on ""Delicious"", the latter of which features Tommy Cash. In 2018, Polachek featured on Felicita's version of the traditional Polish song """", released on their debut studio album Hej! under the title ""Marzipan"".
In 2020, Polachek featured on ""La vita nuova"" by Christine and the Queens and made a guest appearance in the short film around the EP of the same name. The song was later remixed by various producers including PC Music founder A. G. Cook.
On November 4, 2021, Charli XCX released ""New Shapes"" featuring Christine and the Queens and Polachek as the second single from her studio album Crash (2022). In March, she was featured on Australian electronic music producer Flume's single ""Sirens"", released ahead of his upcoming studio album Palaces.


Personal life
=============
Polachek's 2015 wedding to artist Ian Drennan was extensively photographed by Vogue magazine. They divorced in 2017. , she is in a relationship with Matt Copson, an artist. Her father died of COVID-19 in 2020. In October 2023, Polachek co-signed a publicized open letter to President Joe Biden, urging him to call for a ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war.

Early life
==========
André Lauren Benjamin was born in Atlanta, Georgia on May 27, 1975, the only child of real estate agent Sharon Benjamin and collections agent Lawrence Harvey Walker. His single mother raised him in Atlanta, East Point, and Buckhead, where he attended Sarah Smith Elementary School, Sutton Middle School, Northside High School, McClarin Success Academy, and Tri-Cities High School.


Artistry
========
Benjamin's early hip hop influence was Rakim, who inspired him to rap at school talent shows as a teenager. He was also heavily influenced by A Tribe Called Quest, stating that group member Q-Tip is ""kind of like the father of all of us, like me, Kanye, Pharrell"".
In the book How to Rap, several emcees praised his rapping technique; k-os noted Benjamin's intricate songwriting process and ""wicked"" flow, Fredro Starr of Onyx commended Benjamin's ability to unpredictably ""change up [his] flow on every record"", and David Banner said that Benjamin is ""one of the best lyricists ever"" despite his Southern drawl delivery. With the release of Outkast's Speakerboxxx/The Love Below album, Billboard stated that Benjamin had proved himself to be ""an eccentric emo crooner and one of hip-hop's elite at the same time"". Henry Adaso of About.com noted that in Benjamin's solo career, he had developed ""a reputation for stealing the show with nearly every guest appearance"". He has been ranked as one of the greatest rappers of all time by several publications; Billboard ranked him sixth, The Source and About.com ranked him 13th, and Complex ranked him 10th best of the 2000s.
Benjamin began producing music on Outkast's ATLiens album, and later co-founded the production team Earthtone III, which also consisted of Big Boi and Mr. DJ. On Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, he evolved his production by playing multiple live instruments, including keyboards, guitar, acoustic guitar, and tenor saxophone. He has since contributed outside production for Aretha Franklin, Frank Ocean, and Kids See Ghosts, among others. Scarface has called Benjamin the ""Prince Rogers Nelson of Hip-Hop"".


Personal life
=============
Benjamin was in a relationship with singer Erykah Badu from 1996 to 1999, and they had a son together named Seven Sirius Benjamin (b. November 18, 1997).
In 2004, alongside Alicia Silverstone, Benjamin was voted by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) as the ""World's Sexiest Vegetarian Celebrity"". He previously followed a vegan diet but stated in 2014, ""I was a hardcore vegan for 15 years. I've even done raw. But socially it became horrible. I was kind of just sitting at home eating a salad. You become mean. That's not good for you.""Polly Vernon, ""'I'm addicted to creating'"", The Guardian, September 18, 2005.
Benjamin posed for a print advertising campaign by Declare Yourself, a campaign encouraging voter registration among youth for the 2008 United States presidential election. In the ads by photographer David LaChapelle, he had his mouth gagged by a bow-tie in a symbolic function.
In 2019, Benjamin shared that he was diagnosed a few years prior with social anxiety and hypersensitivity disorder.

================


Early life
==========
Kid Cudi was born as Scott Ramon Seguro Mescudi in Cleveland, Ohio, on January 30, 1984. He grew up in Shaker Heights and Solon. He has two older brothers, Domingo and Dean, and an older sister, Maisha. His mother, Elsie Harriet (née Banks), is an African-American school choir teacher at Roxboro Middle School in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. His father, Lindberg Styles Mescudi, was a house painter, substitute teacher, and World War II Air Force veteran of African-American and Mexican descent.
When Cudi was 11 years old, his father died of cancer; his passing had a significant effect on Cudi's personality and music. Cudi attended Shaker Heights High School for two years before transferring to Solon High School. He was expelled from the school for threatening to punch the principal, but later earned his GED. He studied film at the University of Toledo, but dropped out after a year. His subsequent plan to join the Navy did not pan out because of his juvenile police record.


Artistry
========
Musical style
thumb|Kanye West and Cudi performing 808s & Heartbreak at the Hollywood Bowl in September 2015
Cudi's musical style has been described as ""an atmospheric take on melodic rap, with a dollop of charming, off-key singing"". He has also been called ""introspective, with the ability to lay his insecurities on record and expose his fallibility."" In 2015, Kris Ex of Billboard, wrote ""he's always been an emotional artist, dealing with expansive and nebulous feelings in acute and often destructive ways."" Kid Cudi's sound is what inspired and led Kanye West to create his cathartic 808s & Heartbreak (2008), with West later stating that he and Cudi were ""the originators of the style, kinda like what Alexander McQueen is to fashion.... Everything else is just Zara and H&M."" West also complimented Cudi by saying, ""His writing is just so pure and natural and important."" In March 2014, Cudi talked about wanting to provide guidance for young listeners with his music: ""my mission statement since day one [...] all I wanted to do was help kids not feel alone, and stop committing suicide.""In a 2013 article for The BoomBox, the author wrote: ""On [A Kid Named Cudi], Cudi raps and croons over samples and interpolations of Gnarls Barkley, Paul Simon, Band of Horses, J Dilla, Nosaj Thing, N.E.R.D. and Outkast. He melded indie rock, electronica and dubstep seamlessly with hip-hop without pandering or reaching. Before Drake broke through with 2009's So Far Gone, rapping and singing over Swedish indie poppers Lykke Li and Peter Bjorn and John, Cudi tweaked with multi-genre covers and seamless transitions between singing and rapping."" In a 2009 interview with HipHopDX, when speaking on his debut album Cudi stated: ""Well one thing I wanted to do was combine sounds that really bring out intense moods.""
His music has also been described as trip hop. Furthermore, he is known for harmonizing and humming in his music, which helps formulate his signature sound. On 2012's WZRD and 2015's Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven, Cudi incorporated the use of screamed vocals, and can be heard yodeling on his 2016 album Passion, Pain & Demon Slayin'. Throughout the years he has also incorporated elements of psychedelia, R&B, electronica, synthpop, punk and grunge, in his music.
Cudi was gifted a guitar by his manager in 2011, encouraging Cudi to learn. Cudi taught himself how to play the guitar and used the instrument in his rock music throughout his career. Cudi is also a self-taught music producer. In 2021, Cudi appeared on American TV talk show The Shop, where he spoke on his writing and recording process. Cudi mentioned for his early albums he would sit down and write entire verses. However, while working on Kids See Ghosts and Man on the Moon III, he adopted Kanye West's writing process. Instead of writing to a beat, he records a reference track for himself, where he freestyles and hums his way through the beat to get a melody, and fills in the lyrics as they come to him.The Shop: Uninterrupted, Episode 4-02, first aired 25 June 2021. In 2021, during Songwriter's Roundtable for The Hollywood Reporter, Cudi called his music ""space punk rock"".
Stage presence
During his 2013 Cud Life concert tour, Cudi donned a custom made astronaut-esque suit that was designed by noted Hollywood costume designer Jose Hernandez. Officially dubbed the ""Satellite Academy Space Suit"", Joe La Puma of Complex explained, ""It's more than just an interesting clothing choice; the suit represents a transition in his mind-state back to the highly anticipated Man on the Moon III.""
Influences
thumb|Kid Cudi names Snoop Dogg (pictured) as one of his biggest influences.
Cudi's earliest influences include alternative hip-hop groups such as the Pharcyde, A Tribe Called Quest and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. Cudi also cites rappers such as the Notorious B.I.G., Tupac, Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg, Run-DMC, Kurtis Blow, LL Cool J, Salt-N-Pepa, Queen Latifah, Kid 'n Play, N.W.A, Naughty by Nature, Onyx and Public Enemy, as his hip-hop influences while growing up. Speaking to Complex in 2012, Cudi named Doggystyle (1993) as one of his favorite albums of all time, revealing, ""Snoop Dogg is my favorite rapper ever […] It was the first time I was introduced to the man and I thought he was the coolest motherfucker alive. His whole cadence, his delivery, his swag—it was real. It was something that I never heard before.""
Kid Cudi has also credited fellow Ohio native Camu Tao, as an influence. He has also been inspired by the sounds of the O'Jays, Ratatat, MGMT and the Postal Service. In 2010, he began experimenting with rock music; rock acts that inspired Cudi include the Electric Light Orchestra, Jimi Hendrix, Nirvana, the Pixies and Pink Floyd. Kid Cudi also credits English singer-songwriter David Bowie as a ""huge inspiration"". Production wise, Cudi has named Dr. Dre, Swizz Beatz, Timbaland and Kanye West, as his top four favorite producers; also naming Emile Haynie and Plain Pat, calling them ""geniuses"" for seeing his potential before he was even completely aware of it.


Personal life
=============
Drug use
In a January 2013 interview, Cudi revealed that he had stopped smoking cannabis in 2011, both for the sake of his child and due to frustration with constantly being associated with the drug and stoner culture.
In a March 2013 interview, Cudi talked about how his initial sudden and unexpected fame drove him to alcohol and drugs:
However, in 2022, Cudi tweeted about going to rehab for cocaine addiction in 2016:
Mental health
In a 2013 interview, Cudi revealed he had suffered an addiction to anti-depressant medication, which had been prescribed to help him deal with an ""emotional breakdown"" after a failed relationship. Cudi has been open about his addiction to pharmaceuticals in his music, namely the songs ""Dr. Pill"" and ""The Nothing"". In a 2014 interview, Cudi spoke on his struggles with depression and suicidal ideation: ""I've dealt with suicide for the past five years. There wasn't a week or a day that didn't go by where I was just like, 'You know, I wanna check out.' I know what that feels like, I know it comes from loneliness, I know it comes from not having self-worth, not loving yourself.""
In a July 2016 interview, Kid Cudi revealed he suffered from survivor guilt: ""I didn't like that I had money and success and I had made it. Everybody I had ever met in my life, good people, weren't able to experience the same, and I wasn't able to truly enjoy my success. Even though I worked hard for it, it bothered me that I had just had so much and my friends didn't.""
In October 2016, Cudi revealed on his Facebook page that he had checked himself into rehabilitation for depression and suicidal urges.Various sources: In an August 2022 interview with Esquire, Cudi spoke on how two weeks after being admitted to rehab in 2016, he had suffered a stroke, revealing the incident forced him to spend the next few months in physical rehabilitation.
Family
On March 26, 2010, Cudi's daughter, Vada Wamwene Mescudi, was born. Throughout 2012, Cudi was in a custody battle over his daughter. Reports surfaced that Cudi gave up custody after his child's mother accused him of being an absentee father, as well as having violent tendencies and a ""long history of consistent drug and alcohol abuse."" These claims were disputed by Cudi and his attorney in a statement, which noted: ""Cudi did not give up custody but reached an amicable agreement with the mother; that 'both parents are fit and proper persons to have custody of their child,' as stated in the final custody judgment; results came back negative for drugs in a drug test voluntarily taken by Cudi; and that the court acknowledged Cudi attempted to establish a relationship and visit his child since her birth and ""voluntarily provided financial support, including child support, rent and other monthly payments, for his daughter since her birth until the time that a child support order was entered as part of the normal course of the case."" Details of the official custody agreement remain private. Cudi has since purchased a property in Chicago to be close to his daughter.
Relationships
In 2009, Cudi began dating entertainment attorney Jamie Baratta. They were in an on-again, off-again relationship, and were a prominent couple in the music industry. They ultimately broke up in 2012, but not before Cudi dedicated a song to her titled ""Teleport 2 Me, Jamie"", which he recorded as a member of the alternative rock duo, WZRD. In 2020, Cudi wrote ""Sept. 16"", a song titled after the birthdate of his girlfriend at the time, costume designer and actress Raquel Deriane, to whom the song is dedicated.
According to a 2023 lawsuit filed by Cassie Ventura against her former partner Sean Combs, Ventura dated Cudi in or around 2012, resulting in Combs threatening Ventura that he would ""blow up [Cudi's] car."" Cudi confirmed that soon after this threat, his car had exploded.
Religious beliefs
In a January 2013 interview, Cudi said that he believes in God but does not follow an organized religion. He considers himself spiritual but not religious.
Political views
Cudi expressed solidarity with Palestine during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. In November 2023, he signed an open letter calling for a ceasefire and an end to Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip. He called Israel's offensive in Gaza a genocide.

================


Early life
==========
Wonder was born Stevland Hardaway Judkins in Saginaw, Michigan, on May 13, 1950, the third of five children born to Lula Mae Hardaway, and the second of Hardaway's two children with Calvin Judkins.Ribowski, Mark (2010).  Signed, Sealed, and Delivered: The Soulful Journey of Stevie Wonder.  Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, Inc.Hardaway had her first child, Stevie's half-brother Milton, prior to her relationship with Judkins; following her split with Judkins, she rekindled her relationship with Milton's father, coincidentally named Paul Hardaway, who by now had another child of his own – Stevie's stepbrother Larry – and with whom she went on to have two more children, Stevie's half-sister Renee and half-brother Timmy Wonder was born six weeks premature, a condition that, along with the oxygen-rich atmosphere in the hospital incubator, resulted in retinopathy of prematurity, a disease that aborts eye growth and often causes the retinas to detach, which left him blind.
When Wonder was four, his mother divorced his father and moved with her three children to Detroit. Wonder attended Whitestone Baptist Church, where he sang in the choir and became a soloist at age eight. His mother later rekindled her relationship with her first child's father (whose surname was also coincidentally Hardaway), changed her name back to Lula Hardaway, and had two more children.
Wonder began playing instruments at an early age, including piano, harmonica, and drums. He formed a singing partnership with a friend; calling themselves Stevie and John, they played on street corners and occasionally at parties and dances. When Stevie was signed by Motown in 1961, his surname was legally changed to Morris, which (according to Lula Mae Hardaway's authorized biography) was an old family name. Berry Gordy was responsible for creating the stage name of ""Little Stevie Wonder"".
Wonder attended Fitzgerald Elementary School in Detroit. After his first album was released, The Jazz Soul of Little Stevie (1962), he enrolled in Michigan School for the Blind in Lansing, Michigan.


Personal life
=============
Marriages and children
Wonder has been married three times. He was married to Motown singer-songwriter and frequent collaborator Syreeta Wright from 1970 until their amicable divorce in 1972, after which their musical collaboration continued (she sang on 1995's Conversation Peace). From 2001 until 2012, he was married to fashion designer Kai Millard. In October 2009, Wonder and Millard separated; Wonder filed for divorce in August 2012. In 2017, he married Tomeeka Bracy.
Wonder has nine children with five women. Two were born to Yolanda Simmons, whom Wonder met when she applied for a job as secretary for his publishing company.Woman's Own magazine, July 1978, pp. 65–68. Book extract from Stevie Wonder by Constanza Elsner, published by Everest. Simmons gave birth to Wonder's daughter Aisha Morris on February 2, 1975. After Aisha was born, Wonder said ""she was the one thing that I needed in my life and in my music for a long time"". Aisha was the inspiration for Wonder's hit single ""Isn't She Lovely?"" She is now a singer who has toured with her father and accompanied him on recordings, including his 2005 album A Time to Love. Wonder and Simmons also had a son, Keita, in 1977.
In 1983, Wonder had a son named Mumtaz Morris with Melody McCulley. Wonder also has a daughter, Sophia, and a son, Kwame, with a woman whose identity has not been publicly disclosed. Wonder has two sons with second wife Kai Millard Morris. The elder is named Kailand, and he occasionally performs as a drummer on stage with his father. The younger son, Mandla Kadjay Carl Stevland Morris, was born on May 13, 2005 (his father's 55th birthday).
Wonder's ninth child, his second with Tomeeka Robyn Bracy, was born in December 2014, amid rumors that he would be the father to triplets. This turned out not to be the case, and the couple named their new daughter Nia, meaning ""purpose"" (one of the seven principles of Kwanzaa).
Family and health
On May 31, 2006, Wonder's mother Lula Mae Hardaway died in Los Angeles at the age of 76. During his September 8, 2008, UK concert in Birmingham, he spoke of his decision to begin touring again following his loss: ""I want to take all the pain that I feel and celebrate and turn it around.""
At a concert in London's Hyde Park on July 6, 2019, Wonder announced that he would be undergoing a kidney transplant in September.
Religion and politics
Wonder has been a longtime Baptist affiliated with black churches. He was introduced to Transcendental Meditation through his marriage to Syreeta Wright. Consistent with that spiritual vision, Wonder became vegetarian, and later a vegan, singing about it in October 2015 on The Late Late Show with James Corden during the show's ""Carpool Karaoke"" segment.Chambers, Taylor (October 13, 2015), ""Stevie Wonder Went Vegan and He Loves it So Much He Sings About it!"" (VIDEO), One Green Planet. Retrieved October 16, 2015.Bowie, Richard (October 15, 2015), ""Stevie Wonder Creates Impromptu Song About Going Vegan"", VegNews. Retrieved October 16, 2015.
Wonder joined Twitter on April 4, 2018, and his first tweet was a five-minute video honoring Martin Luther King Jr. Dozens of famous personalities were rounded up in the video, which was titled ""The Dream Still Lives"". Each person involved shared their dream, calling back to King's popular speech in 1963. Wonder's first tweet took the Internet by storm, and he also encouraged viewers to share their own videos about their dreams with the hashtag #DreamStillLives.
On August 21, 2024, Wonder performed ""Higher Ground"" at the 2024 Democratic National Convention, endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 United States presidential election. Wonder also briefly spoke at the convention, saying: “This is a moment to tell your children where you were and what you did. When we stand between history's pain and tomorrow's promises, we must choose courage over complacency.""
Ghanaian citizenship
On May 13, 2024, Wonder's 74th birthday, Ghana's President Nana Akufo-Addo conferred Ghanaian citizenship on him. Wonder took the Oath of Allegiance and received his Certificate of Citizenship at Jubilee House in Accra.

Early life
==========
Larry Eugene Hendricks III is originally from San Francisco's Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood, specifically Harbor road (also home to RBL Posse and Prezi).  He was born to teenage parents. At the age of five, he moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where he stayed until the age of 15, though he would return to visit family in San Francisco every summer. After middle school, June attended high school at Jesse Bethel High School in Vallejo, California. His father dabbled in rap, which influenced June. He would distribute CD's with his music to schools in his area, and found a breakthrough after selling his music to a Rasputin Music store in Berkeley. June later dropped out of high school to focus on making music.


Artistry
========
Logan Murdock of The Ringer wrote about June's craft: ""If E-40 is rap's model of independence, June is hip-hop's Jack LaLanne, and he's primed to transform Bay Area rap. He has a mouthpiece like Mac Dre and the soul of RBL Posse, with a mission to make it on his terms, even if celebrity doesn't necessarily follow. June is known to rap about ""passive income"", and has said he does not consider his music to portray him as a ""lifetime coach"", but instead wants to help those from the streets who are trying to make a healthy income. Among his most used ad-libs are ""Yee-hee"", inspired by Michael Jackson, and ""Good job, Larry"", stemming from his ascent in the industry.”
Orange branding
Outside his career as a musician, June plans on releasing his own brand of oranges based on a suggestion from a friend whose family owns a farm. On his social media promotions, June ends his sentences with an orange emoji.

================


Artistry
========
Vocals
Wallace had the vocal range of a baritone. He typically rapped in a deep tone that Rolling Stone described as a ""thick, jaunty grumble"", which became even deeper on Life After Death. Wallace was frequently joined by Combs, who contributed ad libs to his tracks. The Source ""Unsigned Hype"" column described his style as ""cool, nasal, and filtered, blessing his own material"". AllMusic noted Wallace’s talent for layering multiple rhymes in rapid succession, while Time magazine highlighted his ability to deliver multi-syllabic rhymes smoothly. Scholar Adam Krims described his rhythmic style as ""effusive"". Wallace often used onomatopoeic sounds, like ""uhhh"" at the start of tracks such as ""Hypnotize"" and ""Big Poppa"".
Lateef of Latyrx described Wallace as having ""intense and complex flows"", while Onyx's Fredro Starr called him ""a master of the flow"". Bishop Lamont praised Wallace's ability to capture ""all the hemispheres of the music"". Wallace often employed single-line rhyme schemes to bring variety and depth to his flow. Big Daddy Kane noted that Wallace did not need an extensive vocabulary to impress; instead, he ""just put his words together a slick way, and it worked well for him"". Known for composing lyrics in his head rather than writing them down, Wallace occasionally deviated from his usual style. For example, he sang in a slow falsetto on ""Playa Hater"" and adapted to the rapid-fire rhyme flow of Bone Thugs-n-Harmony on ""Notorious Thugs"".
Musical style
Wallace's lyrics explored a range of themes, including mafioso narratives (""Niggas Bleed""), reflections on his drug-dealing past (""Ten Crack Commandments""), materialistic boasting (""Hypnotize""), humor (""Just Playing (Dreams)""), and romantic experiences (""Me & My Bitch""). In 2004, Rolling Stone praised him as ""one of the few young male songwriters in any pop style writing credible love songs"". In the book How to Rap, rapper Guerilla Black highlighted Wallace's ability to ""glorify the upper echelon"" while also making listeners ""feel his struggle"". According to The New York Times journalist Touré, Wallace's lyrics ""[mixed] autobiographical details about crime and violence with emotional honesty"". Another writer for The New York Times, Michel Marriott, noted in 1997 that his lyrics were not entirely autobiographical, as he had a talent for exaggeration to improve his storytelling and sales appeal. Wallace described his debut album, Ready to Die, as ""a big pie, with each slice indicating a different point in [his] life involving bitches and niggaz[...] from the beginning to the end"".
Rolling Stone described Ready to Die as a contrast of ""bleak"" street visions and being ""full of high-spirited fun, bringing the pleasure principle back to hip-hop"". AllMusic noted ""a sense of doom"" in some of his songs, while Jon Pareles of The New York Times described a thread of paranoia in others. Wallace himself stated that he felt ""broke and depressed"" while creating his debut album. The final track on Ready to Die, ""Suicidal Thoughts"", portrays a character contemplating and ultimately committing suicide. On his follow-up album, Life After Death, Wallace's lyrics delved even ""deeper"", as observed by Rolling Stone. Krims observed that the record alternates between upbeat, dance-oriented tracks and gritty ""reality rap,"" reflecting a thematic shift toward a more ""pimp"" persona. XXL Mag noted that Wallace ""revamped his image"" between the two albums, evolving from a ""mid-level hustler"" on his debut to a ""drug lord"" on his sophomore effort. AllMusic credited Wallace's storytelling ability as a key factor in the success of Ready to Die.
